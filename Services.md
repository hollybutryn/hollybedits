*Before we work together, you may be asked to provide a sample of your work so I can provide you with an accurate estimate based on my rates.*

## Proofreading 
### Basic edits that involve making minor changes to documents.  

I will refine your documents by correcting all text and formatting errors before print or distribution.  Proofreading does **NOT** include revising or rewriting.

<br>

## Copy-editing
### Stylistic editing or line-by-line editing for smoothness and clarity while maintaining authorâ€™s voice and style.

I will clarify your meaning and offer suggestions to rewrite your sentences.

<br>

### These services include two editing passes: 
1.  I will edit, then submit the work to the Author for approval; the Author will either accept or reject changes and respond to any queries.
2.  The Author will then return the the work to the Editor, who will incorporate those changes or corrections into a clean copy for the Author.
